Is hard
When I was struggling to view the future in a optimistic way reframing helped me ease by fears.
I was feeling very down and discouraged because I was thinking that I would never find a job different than the job I have now. I was thinking I would always be miserable. I wrote down these negative thoughts in the tool and realized that I was experiencing all or nothing thinking. I reframed my thoughts to more positive thoughts of pointing out that I still have the option of going back to nursing school. I can keep looking for jobs and apply myself at anything that I want. 
It's harddddd 
I sometimes get really really frustrated with work and take it out on those around me. I'm pausing more now and reasoning it through before blaming others.

I have chronic symptoms that sometimes cause me to lose all energy and not be able to meet my goals. However my feelings of failure due to this often cloud my judgement and I blame myself for this. Reframing reminds me that my physical and mental health are linked and I need to take care of both
"It got me to think about possible other reasons for my situations, which normally I don't do. "
Because I was more positive after
This week something happened that I started blaming myself for. Instead of dwelling on it I used some thought-stopping techniques and slowed my negative emotions down.
"There was an issue at work where my boss came in guns blazing with all sorts of negative information regarding company changes and sharing his negative outlooks. In these scenarios prior, I would let myself focus on all negative thoughts I formed based on his thoughts and allow myself to become anxious thinking of all the ways I could be negatively affected by these things even though in the past, things he has told me have not actually happened and I have since realized these are his automatic negative thoughts and his red flag listening tendencies instead of actual information. I would say it went well because I allowed myself to listen to him but I did not allow myself to fall into the trap and spiral down a deep well of negativity which would ruin the rest of my day, even after work hours which would then in turn negatively affect my relationships outside of work. Instead, i let him talk, formed my own opinion, and realized I have no control over corporate changes even if what he was saying is true and then i completed the rest of my work day unphased and had no lingering anxiety after work hours to negatively affect my personal life. "

Hasn't happened
"It has forced me to consider my thoughts actively, and try to find a source for my feelings."
The first time i used the tool was probably the most effective time for me. I found it easy to open up my thoughts and truthfully answer each question. At the time i was in a negative thinking pattern so it did help me work through it in my head and be able to let it go. 
It was a simple negative thought. And the tool allowed me to flip the script easily and I believed the reframed thought and belief.

"I provided the best story on a previous question. But another time was when I was thinking I wasn't good enough for my job or life in general. So many of the options* fit with my thoughts. There were so many directions I could go with to reframe my thoughts. It went well for me because this was the moment that really had me thinking that this might help. It didn't completely help that time, but it gave me hope that this will help if I put in the work.

When I was feeling very hopeless about my finances and convinced that things were never going to improve I tried to reframe and think about how I could find one step to start feeling positive about money and I scheduled a time with my bank to get a more realistic and objective evaluation of my budget and finances in hopes that it would help me see things more positively

nothing changed really 
"I can't note that at least once this tool went really really well, but it happened that it helped. I did it in my free time and even if I only had one negative thought during the day, I used this tool for other negative thoughts which I was thinking and so I didn't think about it anymore that day. "
"Sometimes when I use the tool, it helps me take a little bit of the pressure off of myself. It helps me reframe in terms of knowing that I can go to others for help when I am feeling like I need it."

I was upset because I was in my own head of disappointing everyone around and not feeling useful. but then I remembered they have stepped up Because I shared with them I temporarily broken and trying to fix me. I also trust them to voice if I'm to far back and need to step up. 
It made me think of the positive view

I haven't really used it. 
"The tool works as well as my ability to reason, it cannot fix anything but allows me to self-assess and reframe negative thoughts. It is beneficial to help me work independently treating my side effects and symptoms, thought processes, which may otherwise be dismissed, without acting.
