I used the tool to write down the negative thought of how existence is not worth it if it's mostly working to survive and afford the basics. It's not enough. I went into a bit of a spiral and my reframe was that I can choose to end my life any time I want and not exist. This is not a positive reframe and I was convincing myself that suicide is okay. 
Because it's hard to make yourself believe things sometimes 
"I still think I have a hard time using the tool thinking about politics and how much I hate trumpets because it doesn't alleviate what I believe is that there is right and wrong and wrong is denying humanity, taking away rights, and being cruel."
I wouldn't say there was any time it didn't go well. 
I can't think of anything 
"My dad, who has end stage Alzheimers became non responsive 2 days ago. I tried to focus and use my tools it was very difficult not to focus on dad in an effort to care for myself."
"I was overwhelmed with stressors, resulting in a 12 day inpatient psychiatric admission for suicidal ideation"
""
"There have been times that I've used the tool but I wasn't feeling that bad. Sometimes as I go through it, it feels like I am inflating the negative emotions."

none
when it didn't go well it was because I couldn't think of a reframe and just felt worse about myself
n\/a
already doing this in my head
it is just difficult for me to remember when in a high anxiety situation. 
"the last time I believe, I was having a particularly rough time and my mind just wouldn't change, it can get really bad sometimes and self therapy like this just cant have the effect needed to combat the negative thoughts "
Bad weather. Couldn't drive. It was still bad weather and I still couldn't drive
Today the tool was a little too broad to really help. I had several thoughts racing and it was all relatable items but I could truly separate what my big issue was. I am worried that I'm missing out on my kids life. the tool helped me write it out and slow down but it just seemed to generak.
I don't think there was one.
I didn't put a lot of thought or value into the tool and the exercise 
I didn't use it
So far it has been working well. When I felt a lot of anger my answer seemed forced & silly but at the end I felt much less tense
Feeling like a failure. Nothing seems to help make me feel better 
When I tell myself that it's going to be better or it's not my fault but I don't really believe it.

When I was having panic attacks over my health
I don't know what it's supposed to do 
too soon
I'm to far gone to be helped. 
"Well, generally when you are in the thick of it, you forget to use the rool,"
I kept coming up with refuting arguments 
""
"Most of the time, using this tool has been similar to times I had not used the tool. I feel one could reach the same conclusions just by searching up ""quick remedies for feeling down"". The tool, I feel, only simply states somewhat surface-level approaches to dealing with short-lasting bouts of depressions and does not address those with long-lasting and\/or severe lasting forms of depression. The only thing this tool has done is help me document a particular time my already underlying depression evolved into a particularly severe variant, which to this day, is still not easy to read through. "
"Sometimes, When I use the tool. my mind goes blank and I'm unable to refram my thoughts. "
A time when someone bashed one of my loved ones and ended up in a heated argument. 
They both wanted my attention and it was too much and I got upset
"I was struggling pretty bad one day so I tried to use the tool, but I guess the link wouldn't allow me. I'd say it wasn't really the tools fault, but it is difficult to be able to use something only some of the time, even if I wasn't necessarily feeling as bad as other days."
Past couple days nothing is going well. 
""
I was feeling very isolated and sad due to the weather and holidays passing without spending time with friends or family. I tried to reframe my negative thoughts of loneliness but couldn't escape the bad feelings and ultimately reframing didn't help 
"It made me think about things I didn't want to, which made me feel worse."
N\/a
"In the stress of the week my anxiety increased, as did my negative thoughts and fears. I just didn't even try to stop my negative emotions- I chose to wallow in them."
"There was a situation where I felt extremely emotionally overwhelmed and no matter how hard I tried to step back, regroup, and apply the tool, i just couldn't seem to make it happen. I upset a couple of my really good friends because of this. After I calmed down, I replayed the full scenario in my mind and worked through the steps of what I should have done differently using the tool and how the outcome would have been significantly different. "
""
Everything in my life is a complete avalanche and completely struggling to just breathe. Let alone survive or get better.
"I find my emotions are sometimes too strong to successfully overcome my negative thinking patterns, which can be frustrating because I want to feel differently."
"The other two times i used the tool didn't seem as effective to me, maybe because i had already don't it and it was the exact same thing. I think personally for me doing the same exact tool multiple times doesn't really help me with working through my thoughts. It was very effective the first time i used it but by the third time it just got repetitive and i didn't really feel like it was useful. "
When there are too many emotions and thoughts it was very hard narrow and navigate them with this tool. I had too much to process. So I did the tool for one thought but then was overwhelmed and stopped after that
"The other day I had an overwhelming moment with my kids and it was hard to get them to listen to me, and I got really anxious and ultimately depressed. I tried reframing but couldn't convince myself that I wasn't doing a poor job. "
I tried using it with the fight at work and that was something that impacting me rather deeply. I ended up having night terrors for a few days after even though I had used the tool. 
I was still dwelling on the thought and felt more pissed after honestly
"The last time I think the dominance of anxiety I have about my situation is such that there is a lot to unpack. It's more complex than one negative thought. I had already reframed it outside the tool, but actually acting on a positive belief or behavior versus still feeling overwhelmed and latching onto the negative ones is difficult to do."
The tools makes me feel like I'm excusing my actions too much and that I'm responsible for more than I think.
"I had some dark thoughts. Pretty sure I shared that one here too. But I feel like nothing can top those thoughts. Suicidal ideations, feeling like my life will never improve. I still feel these things and I have never been able to reframe these. Therapists haven't. Reading up on how to make it better hasn't. I feel like it's just reality. "
none
Thinking about negative situations at work and something I was put in. While I was mentally reframing my thought more stuff kept happening and felt like it was crashing around me. 
"In a moment of panic, when thoughts were racing fast, was unable to take time to slow down and think of a plan."

"Because I can't reframe my thoughts for two reasons:
1. I can't think of an alternative
2. When I think of one I feel I'm tricking myself... how would I know which is more accurate or useful if I invent both?"
"After the first use, the times using the tool felt less helpful. I felt like I already had a framework for reframing from my first time and it wasn't necessarily helpful to use the tool again."
This is still new and a learning process. 
Nothing so far the tool has been very helpful 
My self doubt and behavior patterns took over
I have a harder time using the tool when I'm having anxiety because it's the things I can't control that make me anxious 
I waited until I was too upset to try to use the tools that I learned. My anxiety was already to bad. I realize I need to try to use these tools and rethinking before it gets that bad.
I was so frustrated and upset that I could hardly work out any reframing thought that could help me get out of it.
When already upset trying get myself to better place a negative comment was made about how I am now days and for rest day i was completely negative? Feel like everyone selfish.  
thinking abt my PTSD I didn't see a tool for it

It's hard to reframe EVERY negative thought
it helped every time I used it
"I have been feeling lonely and convinced that my partner doesn't care about me.  I tried to reframe those thoughts and look at other stressors he might be going through that are preoccupying him.  That didn't really make me feel any better , I think because there was no real validation from him to back up my reframed thought "
see my problem is I can't get things out of my head that's my problem It's not like I can just think of something and forget about something else cuz I'm thinking about 20 things at once even more like recently I will see a disturbing photo or something on the internet or somewhere and out of nowhere I'll just start picturing it in my head and I can't get it out and it's like makes me sick to my stomach because of the images it that they are.
There wasn't.
i'm not sure
This hasn't happened yet 
I'm very concerned about my mother and having a hard time reframing the negative thoughts. her health is very concerning to me.
Not applicable 
One time when I tried reframing I was more just going through the motions. It was not very helpful.
There were not any.
The third time I used it it wasn't really useful because I wasn't in the worst mood. So I feel like I kinda disregarded it.
So far it's been going well. I'm finding it very helpful. 
nothing changed really 
"Sometimes the questions themselves drive you into even greater depression. Questions like ""do you think no one needs you."" So I want to shout that it's true and that's exactly what I think, besides, sometimes it's just hard to imagine that everything will get better and be fine. The feeling that nothing will be good at all. And it's very difficult to set yourself up for the positive."
"I feel like the tool helps, but most of the time, it only helps a very little bit."
Some days I can't sit back and think of my options I'm to anxious or worried of what the outcome can be.
I was having a negative thought about dying and while I could see that this is a future problem and to shift my thinking using the tools I feel like it only tmeporaily worked out.
""
I don't think I have an example 
"If I don't strongly believe the thinking trap, then it doesn't go as well. "
food related. I watched videos of desserts and then ate 2 large bags of chips while being distracted. I tried to reason with myself that I am working on this part of me bit I couldn't get past the idea I should have more discipline and there is no excuse for over eating. I then ate more 
There was no example to find a positive view 
""
see comment above.
"When I use the tool and it doesn't work too well it's because I have a long standing relationship with my negative thoughts. At this point in my life I've convinced myself these thoughts are all true. So if the tool doesn't work for me a time or two I'd say it just shows that my thoughts are unhealthy, not that the tool doesn't work."
I have to ask for help when things do not go right.

I get upset and in my head with sports even though it's my first time playing this sport and I can't shake every thought that I'm not good enough no matter how hard I try to rationalize it
NA
I will let you know when I use it. 
it reignited thinking about the issue that i had resolved earlier in the day
The tool doesn't do anything for me. My major depressive disorder is far too gone at this point for the tool to be of any help for someone like myself. 
""
So far not much luck and not much change
"I can't just turn these thoughts off. I can tell myself how to put a positive spin on it, but in some cases I feel like I'm fooling myself."
I have not been mad
Keep having thoughts of wife w ex bf from long ago
""
The first time I used the tool I was still in my emotions and thoughts. However I knew that if I did not want to put the bad aside I could never allow this to be beneficial for me. I knew that I had to put in some work in order to see an outcome and it worked. The second or third time I was able to put aside my biases towards a situation and approach situations in a more optimistic way.
""
"I don't know if I'd say it 100% didn't go well, but the hardest thing I examined so far was the rejection by my husband's family. I kind of hit a wall in coming up with things to combat that by myself."
"Despite reframing my thoughts, I still felt sick and anxious. "
"When there was objective information. I attempted to reframe my thoughts, but felt i began ""spiraling"" for a few hours. "
I was on the couch feeling lonely and I tried to redirect my thoughts and found it very difficult to do.
I'm mostly not using it too well. I feel I'm really stuck in the same emotion a lot of the time when I use it and in a common thought pattern for me that's hard to really shake.
Have not run into this quite yet
""
I was arguing with my husband about how much time he's at work and how I need help at home too. I was very emotional and I didn't stop to think about the time he is sacrificing away for us to make sure we're able to pay rent and afford food. So I just shut down and didn't talk to him the rest of the night. 
Not really. 
I did not have this experience. Things went well for me each time I used the tool. 
"was thinking about negative thoughts like robbers coming in and stealing and hurting us and I was using the tool and it said intrusive thoughts could be ""SELF prophesying"" so it ultra scared me instead of making me feel better because now I feel like I'm going to make this bad stuff indeed happen "
If I don't work hard at the reframe the negative thoughts become too strong
I didn't have that experience. 
"The tool didn't work because I didn't work it, but it has been helping me to change mental directions when I remember to use it."
"I'm a person that needs the last word in any type of conflict, my husband is the same way. I really need to work on not being that way"
""
I still ended up feeling the same
I think it made me think I was worse off if I couldn't reframe a situation. it was like a confirmation bias that things wouldn't get better 
I still couldn't stop worrying.
I really didn't have time that things didn't go well. It was a lot better using this tool to make things make more sense 
I think I need to use it more for it to readily come to mind for use in daily moments of stress or unease
Honestly I'm not sure there was a time when I used the tool and it didn't go well... If anything I believe there was a time when I used the tool when I was tired and didn't practice patience to use the tool.
this is my first 
"I still hold on to some beliefs surrounding my relationship that I will never be truly loved or wanted or prioritized. I really really want to believe these things, and as much as my partner tries to reassure me, I have a mental block where I'm unable to accept that it's the truth. If I believe these things and they turn out not to be true, it will hurt so much more."
Practicing 
"Similarly, I've chosen a negative thought that did not lend itself well to the tool's system. It was a far more subjective thought that didn't easily work within the reframing process or lead to a clear outcome. "
The tool truly seemed to help when I did use it throughout the week. 
Because of the circumstances of what I was going though 
"After reframing thoughts on the awareness of death, it didn't curb the intensity of my emotions or leave me with a sense of satisfaction by understanding it. It didn't feel like I found a solution for my fear."
allways
"The tool mostly served to let me know that I was going to be worrying about my issue for hours, and it just pissed me off."

"I was worried about not getting into medical school because of a few bad grades that I have. With larger thought spirals that seem a lot further out (like medical school applications), the tool was not as helpful, since I have no idea what my application cycle results will be in two years. Because the tool was not able to help, I feel like it is probably best to use for reoccurring daily thoughts, rather than larger life worries like med school. "
I was using a saw and thought how easy it would be to let it slip. I thought about the tools you provide and it didn't help. mama walked up and I didn't cut my arm open
"I wouldn't say that it didn't go well, but it wasn't as helpful during a certain situation. I felt like I was a bad friend because I barely ever answer texts. Although the tool helped me see that not answering the phone doesn't equate to being a bad friend, I still felt\/feel bad that I could possibly miss something important when a friend is in need."
I haven't used it 
"Reframing perspectives is beneficial, although it is useful to change negative thinking into what has been interesting in conversations with others.  When I present an issue in negative contexts, others are less likely to be willing to discuss it with me and they are right.  Everything is not all about me, but I have to let go of the things that are annoying me and understand it will pass if I let it go. Hanging on to negatives keeps me feeling unsatisfied with myself.  Being negative is a put off. Processing the thoughts of even bad events, can lead to good identifying beneficail elements."

there are no reminders sent to reaffirm positive thoughts.

It doesn't go well when I try to use the tool about feelings I have about my fathers' illness. I have it stuck in my head that staying mad about his illness is easier than accepting it. 
"I'm stuck in a negative thought storm due to my husband having an affair.  I'm not sure it didn't go well, just can't overcome the negative thoughts."

"There hasn't been a time that the tool has gone well, but every time I use it, it doesn't completely eliminate. My negative thought. It just helps make them less strong."
