didn't have a time on this one 
"I tried to use the tool to help myself with an insecurity about a receding hairline, where I was given a prompt for a reframe to tell myself whenever negative feelings come up. I was with a group of friends, wearing a hat, and one girl was talking about how her ex now was balding. She mentioned how he was too ugly to be worth her time anymore. It hit me hard, as I imagined being seen in a similar way. I couldn't shake the thought, even when using the reframe. If anything the reframe felt hollow in that moment of shame (and I had planned on taking my hat off at some point as it was warm, but decided against it due to the shame.  "
""
"Sometimes the emotion can still linger after using the tool so depending how strong the feeling is, it can take a little longer to think in the positive."
I've been having problems getting help from mental health providers and the reframes didn't help to change my negative thinking about the issue. It just reminded me how difficult it is to find help. 
I still struggle with it most days. It just gets in your head and you don't even realize it. I think it is something that will take years to reset when you have thought this way almost your whole adult life. 
"I wouldn't say the tool has ever not gone well.. at most it is a little frustrating when it feels like a generic answer. I had an issue where my manager got me in trouble for missing a day that I had approved and it said to clear things up with them, I had already tried that, so it was a little annoying to see that the most obvious answer was staring me in the face. But it did have another suggestion alongside where I'd look for other work, and that made me a little less stressed "
The only time it did not go well was because I literally could not control how my boyfriend acted to my family. So my reframe did not work for me because he acted stupid and did things to spite me he said. 
I haven't had a time when it wasn't useful.
"When I'm believing that something will happen because my family is  chaotic and damaging to my mental health and my own home life.
It didn't go well because I was right in someway or another."
it's become too repetitive. vague negativity triggers a broken record of platitudes. but often vague negativity is what plagues me. ennui is not helped
Hard to rethink some thoughts and stop anxiety from creeping in
"When I was feeling particularly stuck, and I didn't find it very helpful that the tool would reframe my thought by saying things like i can be positive, things with change, or that I didn't have to worry. It seemed too simple and was hard to believe."
"Not a specific time, but I didn't think much about using it without the text reminders"
"When I felt upset about living situation , felt like nothing would change regardless of reframing thoughts "
"I was having negative thoughts, and none of the reframing tools came to mind so i ended up having a panic attack. "
"this would be the first time when using the tool, as I didn't think simply changing my language about a thought might actually shift the way I was feeling or approaching my problem. I remember feeling a lot of skepticism even after the first exercise."
""
Again I just started
""
it just didn't have very good answers for some of my feelings but I added to the reframe
One day I was just feeling sad but was unable to really articulate why and I had trouble picking the AI suggestion or coming up with my own
everyday when not at work. like I said it's a work in progress
It's not going well because the reframing sounds like lies to me...bullshit. And I always say I don't lie to myself.

This situation hasn't happened yet
I used the tool speaking about the situation I'm currently living in and the tool said I should seek out domestic violence shelters and call the shelters and hotline for Amy assistance I can get to get away from the toxic environment I'm on because it is not healthy and I cannot thrive in it. and I was like.....DAMN.. that'sy life.?omg!!!! that's my life?? I was blind by addiction or stupidity or I don't know what bug oh my God I didn't want to see or admit that is my life it's talking about. domestic violence shelters saying I'm in an environment that is unhealthy for me and I can't thrive here because it's not stable and it's a lot of negativity in my life right now weighing on me and I feel hopeless and trapped. every time I get away I end up coming right back. because it's raining or it's a windstorm and you can't be out there. I can't even get far enough away to make it away to stay away. and I don't got any destination at all anyway 
"Even though I recognized the positive thought, I would still convince myself it was something negative, at times. "
A time it didn't go well was when it gave me a reframed thought that felt like it didn't understand the root of the problem.
fighting with my mom and she makes me so mad I can't think at all
None
the depression overpowers my mind
""
I found out my husband had invited another woman to move into our house so he could have sex with her without even talking to me about it. none of the reframing thoughts could get past my hurt and confusion
The first time I used the tool I don't think I took it very seriously so I didn't get as much out of it as I could have. 
There wasn't really a time that it didn't go well
It's never useful and never gives any response that is helpful in any way.
there wasn't really a time it went badly 
cause I started crying 
Hasn't happened yet
I tried listening to music when I had been overstretched and I ended up listening to depressing music which made it worse.
"The feedback about my religious discrimination concern. I understand that my boss might have reasons to not accommodate me, but this does not excuse discrimination practices "
""
I just was to overwhelmed 
I have not had this situation arise yet.
""
"A time when using the tool did not go well is, really, most times when I am feeling strongly because the reframes can be comforting but are not enough to change my beliefs."
I kept getting distracted 
It didn't go well because things are not better just because I told someone what was happening.  I am not richer.  My shit is not less in the trashcan.  I am no further from this hell hole than I was.  I do not qualify for more services than I had.
One of my negative thoughts is very specific and I had a really hard time finding a reframe that felt helpful. 
haven't really experienced this. it has been very beneficial each time I used it.
to many distractions
"Once I used the tool and the automatic suggestions didn't really fit me. So I came up with my own. However, the tool was still able to give ideas as to why it was happening. "
there wasn't a time
I don't think there was a time it didn't go well or do what it was supposed to do
I haven't used it and gotten a negative result yet.
Just when I don't try to counter them soon enough. They got overwhelming and nothing was calming them down.
"no, not really. everything has been pretty helpful."
Nothing yet 
It did go well
I used it for a work situation and I still actively feel awful there just in general I genuinely do believe they actively sabotage me every chance they get 
Right after my cycle started I tried to use it and the AI generated answers made it seem worse. but everything makes it feel worse so I'm not sure if that's just because of me or because of the situation. 
"Feeling lonely, depression spiraled. It was hard to focus. "
I tried to let my walls down with my husband but I just couldn't. the next time we argued I just folded and put my walls back up. I tried reframing my thoughts but I couldn't convince myself. I still have a hard time trusting.
I have not used it yet
Permanent health problema
"Today's my birthday, and it's the first birthday that I haven't looked forward to. I received a generous gift from my father, and a beautiful drawing from my daughter, but I haven't been able to talk myself out of feeling like this is a crappy day."
what yool
it's hard for me right now to put it to work
Not applicable. 
None of the times 
I can't recall an event where I used the tool and didn't go well. 
n\/a
I do not remember a time when it didn't go well. Maybe it was just neutral for me. 
"The tool isn't able to assuage my fears about not being able to get a job. It feels like it's trying to ""toxic positivity"" me out of a material problem, and makes me feel more inadequate than a more grounded approach would."
This hasn't happened to me.
Repeating and having to explain multiple time on what mad me agree
I honestly don't think I had a time using it that didn't go well. I was very pleased with it every time I used it.
I have used the tool when the situation has passed and it is sometime difficult to reconstruct my feelings and thinking.
"I just learned I am being evicted, I was caught in the negative thinking of I don't know what I am going to do and I recognized the negative thought but couldn't come up with a realistic solution plan."
"High anxiety days, the tool doesn't really help because I can't focus on it. "
N\/a
I haven't had many issues yet.
I haven't had a bad experience with this tool yet!
sometimes it doesn't always work out in your favor and it's Ok 
it's worked every time 
The reframing box didn't load for like 2 minutes maybe it was my internet conenction
I was worried about people at work finding out I'm on Seroquel (I'm a community pharmacist) then the Rx wronly got sent to my pharmacy and I freaked out and nothing but wanting to and beginning to act on killing myself worked. 
It seemed repetitive 
N\/A
The first time using the tool. I have a really hard time believing that I am worth it or believe I am capable of doing good things
"I haven't had this experience, yet."
"I find that when I am On social Media, I start to feel lonely. And it is difficult to get out of that spiral. "
"I used the tool to think about my negative situation at work. The tool suggested I talk to my boss about sharing my workload. I do this weekly (60 weeks so far) and she never revamps the workload. I would say it didn't go well because I'm 3-times older than my coworkers, suffer from Stage 3 arthritis, and my coworkers still have less responsibility for the workload than I do. They get lunch. I do not. They get holiday pay. I do not. They do not have to wash our laundry & dishes, answer the doorbell, or put things away. I do. "
there wasn't a time when the tool didn't go well
My self doubt over powers everything 
I couldn't control my racing thoughts. 
Still just beginning.
I haven't really had a good or bad experience with it. 
it didn't really go bad at all.
I dont know if there were times where it wasnt explicitly unhelpful but there was one attempt where the reframing was still very anxiety provoking for me personally
"I can't say it went well or unwell. this question is confusing and I don't understand. sometimes I don't agree with the reframe that much, and I feel like I'm trying to brainwash myself. with a positive thought so it is positive brainwashing. "
i havent had a time wherenit didnt go well yet
n\/a
I dont think there was a time where it didn't work well but there were definitely times some of the things it gave me didn't resonate as much as some of the others 
"There was one time where I felt as though I was not keeping up with my peers. While the tool did comfort me and tell me that people go at their own pace in life, I wish I could have developed more of an action plan."
Not applicable 
I just don't see this kind of thing very useful so far 
When it comes to school and work I automatically think I'm a failure. It's hard to use the tool when I see the evidence that I'm not as good as I want to be
I have not had this experience yet
I'm getting annoyed right now because my sleep is getting mossed
not available 
Wondering if it's just me 
same as above
the only time I try to use a tool and it didn't go well is when I was emotionally upset and crying because of someone else it wasn't necessarily because of the tool. but when someone is in your face berating you it's hard to frame a negative thought.
can't say there has been one
I didnt
The first time I used the tool it didn't really help cause the situation was practically over ( I didn't take the correct steps but rather incorrect ones already)

"The tool is designed for individuals that struggle with negative thinking as a result of struggling to control or regulate emotions and thoughts. It's not designed for people that have actual mental issues going on. .
"
"In a similar situation as stated above, but just going back and forth with negative and positive thoughts."
"My body's nervous system is currently on high-alert mode due to being stuck in a toxic living situation until I finally move out. So the negative thoughts are very excessive and intrusive. I'm living with my ex who moved on quickly after breaking up with me. So I think my situation doesn't allow the tool to be as consistently effective as it might be once I'm finally in an emotionally safe environment. So sometimes after using the tool, my thoughts still might spiral if I can hear my ex in the other room. I avoid him like the plague, but I can't completely avoid his presence ands it's highly triggering. "
The tool feels too generic.
Have not yet experience this. 
""
I cannot remember what it exactly was but I was upset over something regarding my failed VO career and the tool didn't comfort me at all. I felt that I wasn't being listened to and no real solutions were provided
Haven't experienced this yet.
Not that it didn't go well. Just not thinking about using it 
I don't know
"I can't remember the exact issue, but I'd used the tool too many times in a row over a couple days. By the time I did another reframe, I think I was a bit burnt on the process and the reframe didn't resonate."
I feel indifferent 
""
"I was thinking about my Blaze, who disappeared 8 years ago, and I fell into a depression.. and when that happens, nothing will help "
I do not knowno really 
"I think the first time using it, I wasn't taking it very seriously. Also, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was easy to get the hang of. "
N\/A
I just started using it
"I did the exercise, but didn't believe the results. This sent me down a spiral of failing to progress and feeling like a failure. "
When I was angry and I couldn't stop thinking about what made me angry 
whenever someone tells me anything about myself I flip. why? because they caused my pain and suffering. yet because of my reaction or anything i say I'm wrong. I lost everything just because that person felt like doing things about nothing.
Too many negative emotions at once kinda affects the ability to have something or someone change it in a matter of minutes in my opinion 
""
""
At home when my kids were stressing me
"Using the tool so far, there has not been a time that it didn't go well , although with events today, my negative thinking was correct."
""
Have not encountered that yet 
"honestly, it was pretty great every time"
""
sometimes the suggestion doesn't get to the real root of the problem.
I tried to ease my anxiety over the thought that my sisters will die before me and I will be left alone in my old age. I just could not believe the reframed messages and my anxiety did not go down. 
It couldn't come up with a reframe that I liked and took a long time to load
Some of the selections for the tool were not relatable to my situation 
"At one point I believe I used it to try and reframe a negative thought related to friends not caring about me - it had been a weird week of many people not responding to me, blowing off plans, flaking out or rescheduling and I was really frustrated and felt unappreciated. I don't think reframing the negative thought helped because these instances of friends cancelling continued throughout the week and I just felt like I was in a negative headspace \/ irritated and one re-frame wasn't helpful. "
I can't really think of a time when I've used the tool and it didn't go well
Couldnt stop the racing thoughts
I have never used it tool for my situation
I couldn't find the right words for my negative thought. It ended up not being quite right. That's on me though. 
na
when I got fired bc that was prolly too big of a thing for this app to handle. 
N\/A.
i havent had a situation like this as of yet. 
I use the tool every time a situation arises that gives me anxiety. And it just didn't help. 
Nothing really to report here
none
