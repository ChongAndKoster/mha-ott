"I wish the options for expanding on reframes (make it more applicable or actionable, give me support, etc) were further expanded! I think they work quite well to compliment the AI reframes, and I would love to see more of them. In addition, I wish there were more actionable steps or options built into the reframes, or at least possible to be utilized. One thing I've really struggled with is being able to use the reframe once or twice, but then crumbling over time. I wish the reframes were more dynamic, or offered more interaction with them after you complete each activity"

Glad to be in this study.
No
thank you
Not this time 
I wish the reframe took was available even after the study. I love it!
I like the tool.
I believe that this type of Therapy can help people and possibly improve their thought patterns. I think in my case my Thought patterns aren't normal due to the trauma I have experienced in my  lifetime

No.
The suggestions were helpful but repetitive since the negative thoughts were frequently similar
No thanks 
Im not sure if this works.

It's nice seeing how the reframes can be expanded. It would help if that section stood out more.

Do you really think AI can take the place of a trained professional or can help solve the underlying issues that have lead to someone being in a vulnerable mental health state?

"I realize that the reason for the study is to get feedback, but did anyone actually review these suggestions before they got offered?  I don't say this to be mean.  And maybe it's the autism but I can't even hear the voice in it."
I am excited to use this tool more. 
I hope I can continue using this forever!

"I found usefull that AI suggested different options of reframing, not just same sentence by different words."
"Sometimes the AI does unpredictable switches in tense or POV speaker (going from first to second person mid-reframe), and I think its grammar could use some tuning."

This is a really great tool and I think it will help a lot of people.

I do like this tool very much - the steps to take AI generation was very different and helped me figure out a plan (or at lease look at one) for the current moments

I think it might help to include suggest to the tool user that they can use bits and pieces from the AI reframe options to create their own reframe. I was only a little hesitant on whether I was allowed to do that or whether I had to come up with something completely original if I chose to write my own. But it still may help other people using the tool think of that too.
The AI suggestions are too generic and not 100% accurate to problem solve
