I think that writing down thoughts and emotions is extremely beneficial in working through them and realizing when thoughts aren't really true. It helps to find a way out of negative thoughts and emotions. 
No
is there a way to mix up the tool\/the questions asked? it's getting repetitive.
No other feedback.

Helpful tools for sure.
Thank for you allowing me to participate.

I am noticing far fewer negative thoughts because I'm shutting them down before they fester.

"i honestly haven't had that bad of an episode lately. my mood is to tolerable levels, and usually the negative feelings are more like tired or being over the semester than like an adverse reaction to a regular thing. so maybe it has helped? im not sure"
no
I'm very interested in continuing to try and use this tool often.
this has been really good study for me as far as helping me
need to try something else

"I like it, but it's probably better suited for low to medium mental illness, but that's just my opinion "
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't work for me depending on the day and my present situation.
I do really get value from the tool.
I find myself using these tools on a daily basis. I have thoughts that people are out to make my life miserable but most of the time it's just my imagination.

Only suggestion is to find other negative examples per week.

I am enjoying this
Not much help
I can give better answers after a few times of using it. these questions on the first time seem irrelevant to any perceived success I may have. give it some time!
negative reframing tools should be incorporated somehow in school at a young age

would love to see something different next week

"As I have stated in other written summaries here, I do not believe the coping tools are ultimately effective; I feel my depression would flow relatively the same way did I not discover the tool. But again, that may be because I am not applying myself to these tools as I should be; I have had that problem before. However, I still, more or less, stand by my original statement in regarding the tools and methods listed in the tool is ineffective in most cases of severe and chronic depression. 
For better help in your research, I am not on any medication nor am I consulting\/resolving this problem with any other parties and\/or methods (counselors, therapists, etc.) other than those methods I have stated in this survey. "
I am hopeful  that the strategy of the tool will be helpful.

I am hopeful that being more familiar with the tools will yield better results in week 2.
"I think it is useful to use the same tool or strategy when dealing with or working through negative thoughts, but i would say my biggest issue was the fact that each time i used the tool it offered me the exact same words and everything. i really enjoyed using it the first time but it seemed less and less effective each time i used it.

I think some sample reframing thoughts would help.
This would be best for someone with little problems or maybe one its not the best for ones in my place so much. Id prefer someone who actually just let me vent  
I don't have any thoughts I enjoy doing all the tools

I'm open to try anything for as long as it takes but I don't see this hoping same with the EMDR I tried it and my therapist that I have a lock or suppressing something
I'm almost interested in continuing to do the thought trap work even after this is all done.

"I think a reminder type system might help, because when I'm in a thinking trap I don't really think of anything else at the time"
I'm looking forward to the coming weeks doing this.

"This survey is a bit long, I am already tired and it takes a bit of my time and I try to work and study at the same time so that is a little difficult. 

When you feel depressed, doing something complicated is the last thing you want to do. I want a quick dopamine, not boring questions. I prefer the question where you just have to choose the answer rather than write a detailed answer because it's a little boring and annoying, but that's my opinion."
I don't think so.

I am working on my emotions as well so that my negative thoughts are not overwhelming me.

"Not that I can think of, thank you."
I think it partially comes down to the type of anxiety. I know my anxious thoughts aren't 'real' but that doesn't get rid of the sick feeling. 
NA
It is more difficult to stay focused on positive thoughts when I am not as busy.
I guess the timing of when I use the tool isn't very helpful. I get stressed about notifications and things on my phone so I often ignore things until I'm in a slightly better way to deal with them. So I don't know if I'm using things right or doing it right.
I should be able to provide better feedback as I get farther into this and have more time to put it to solid use

I think it's hard for me to stop and reevaluate situations that I've been in for years.

It's only the first week for me so my experience and skill with the tool and application of thought reframing is minimal. With more practice and better familiarity with the thought traps themselves I'll be better able to choose topics that better fit and judge the effectiveness of the technique for me personally.

I don't know that I will ever be able to change my way of thinking about my fathers illness. 
More time might help me learn this technique better.
