Situation: I know why I am so angry all of the time. like I have this little monster in my head. It just makes me want to abandon everything and hide from everyone so I lash out anymore. I just hate my brain.
Distorted Thought: I am crazy.
Original Reframe: I am not crazy, but I have anger issues.
Actionable Reframe: I can take proactive steps to manage my anger, such as exploring relaxation techniques and mindfulness.

Situation: I invited a co-worker out and they turned me down
Distorted Thought: They will never want to go out with me
Original Reframe: I'm sure their response was not about me, this coworker must have other things going on
Actionable Reframe: Next time I invite someone out, I can be more open about why I am extending the invitation and let them decide freely without feeling pressure.

Situation: My wife has left me.
Distorted Thought: I'm going to be alone
Original Reframe: Being left by my wife hurts, but it doesn't necessarily means I will be alone forever
Actionable Reframe: I can reach out for help and support from family and friends during this time.

Situation: First interview after studying and getting my diploma.
Distorted Thought: I'll screw it over
Original Reframe: There is no way of knowing exactly how the interview will go at this time
Actionable Reframe: I can do my best to prepare for the interview by researching the company, studying the job description, and practicing answering potential questions.

Situation: Last week I found out that my mother had experienced sudden back pain that lasted for a few days  and I somehow worked myself into a very concerned state where I kind of felt like she was going to become completely incapacitated and have to live in a nursing home.
Distorted Thought: I'm afraid she's going to die soon.
Original Reframe: My mother may have experienced sudden back pain because she was gardening for several hours the day before. The back pain is likely a result of the time spent leaning forward and is nothing to worry about.
Actionable Reframe: I can speak to the doctor that treated my mother and inquire about helpful tips to prevent similar issues with her back in the future."""
